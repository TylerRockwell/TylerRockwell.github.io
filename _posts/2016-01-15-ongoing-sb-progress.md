So, each entry into this post will follow this format:

* Date
* What did you learn yesterday?
* What are you going to do today?
* What do you expect to learn?

Each entry should be relatively short, but important topics may expand
out into their own posts. We'll see.

## January 15, 2016

### What did you learn yesterday?

Today is day 3 of my Smashing Boxes adventure. Day 1 was orientation,
meeting with the teams, awesome lunch at Dashi, overall just getting situated.
Yesterday was when I first started doing *work*. My first project is to build
a Twitter clone. What makes this more challenging for me is that I must use
Devise for authentication and rSpec for testing. I'm getting a handle on rspec.
It's pretty straight forward, it's just a matter of learning the syntax differences
between it and minitest. I spent a lot of time looking over the Devise docs. It's
easy enough to generate a user model and get a working authentication system in,
but everything feels hidden away, so customization has been tricky.

tl;dr: I learned a lot about Devise and rspec.

### What are you going to do today?

So this entry is being done a little late today, so I've already been working on
some things. I got a test that I was struggling with yesterday (Putting to the
update action within the Devise User Registration Controller) working. I updated
my branch to meet the criteria my **awesome** mentor Annie (Hi Annie!) put forth
for me. This afternoon I will work on putting together the user profile page, and
if I have time start working on follower/following capabilities.

tl;dr Keep working on my Twitter clone

### What do you expect to learn?

I expect to continue gaining experience with rspec and Devise. I'm working on my
ability to not just produce working code now, but code that is good as well.

tl;dr It's 2 sentences. Just read it.
