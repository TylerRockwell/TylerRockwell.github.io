### What did you learn yesterday?

Yesterday I learned how your experience level as a dev influences the way you approach
software design. My current design approach is to find a place within the app that
seems appropriate to put the new behavior into, and start building it there. Since
starting up my career in programming, my approach has evolved from "make this thing
work" to "make this thing work and write it decently". After pairing with Brian yesterday,
I have seen the mindset of an experienced dev, and it's a very different approach.

As we worked together, we talked about what the feature needs to do today, where it
may be best to put different pieces of the behavior, what this feature might need to
be capable of, and how best to write this feature to be easily extendable in the
future without writing out a bunch of behavior now that may never be used.

I may not be able to put everything I learned into practice right away, but it
seems like another step on the way to becoming a better coder.

### What are you going to do today?

SmashingDocs seems like it is ready to be used, so hopefully that message can be
passed around the office today. I may work on DRYing up the test suite for it.

This afternoon, I'm pairing with Tyler, (Tyler McCraw, my coworker, not myself in
the 3rd person). I'm not sure what we'll be working on, but I know every day of pairing
will be unique.

Also, Brandon asked for some feedback on the apprenticeship lecture series, so I'll
write that up for him today.

### What do you expect to learn?

Like I said, I'm not certain what will be covered today in my pairing session, but
I'm sure I'll have a lot to write about tomorrow.

### What did you learn yesterday?

Starting the new month with the new post instead of waiting 2 weeks. See, I'm learning here.
Yesterday I spent the second half of the day pairing with Derek, and about an hour meeting
with Lucas and Andy from Design.

From pairing with Derek, I got some experience with the workflow of a client project.
He did a great job of giving me some background on Jira, picking work from sprints/backlogs
and taking an issue through development and on to code review. A couple things stood out to
me yesterday. One was that the problems we were working on totally felt like issues I could solve,
so that gave me confidence that I'll be able to contribute to client work and be a productive
team member. The other thing I noticed was that Derek came to solutions on issues that came up
much faster than I would have. I think that's one of those skills that comes with experience.

I also got some insight into what the design team does beyond just making things look good.
There seems to be a lot of thought and work that goes into every design decision, and there is
a lot more involvement with the client than I first realized. Rather than being a segmented piece
of development, design seems to permeate all the steps from start to finish in our projects.

### What are you going to do today?

This morning, I'll be fixing some documentation on SmashingDocs. It's missing some instructions
regarding the new configs. This afternoon I'm paring with Brian, so I'm sure I'll learn a lot of
new things from him.

### What do you expect to learn?

It's interesting to see everyone's different workstyles. Everyone approaches things a
little differently, and I think this pairing tour will help me get a view of all the
different styles people have here.
