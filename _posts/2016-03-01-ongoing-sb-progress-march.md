## March 1, 2016

### What did you learn yesterday?

Starting the new month with the new post instead of waiting 2 weeks. See, I'm learning here.
Yesterday I spent the second half of the day pairing with Derek, and about an hour meeting
with Lucas and Andy from Design.

From pairing with Derek, I got some experience with the workflow of a client project.
He did a great job of giving me some background on Jira, picking work from sprints/backlogs
and taking an issue through development and on to code review. A couple things stood out to
me yesterday. One was that the problems we were working on totally felt like issues I could solve,
so that gave me confidence that I'll be able to contribute to client work and be a productive
team member. The other thing I noticed was that Derek came to solutions on issues that came up
much faster than I would have. I think that's one of those skills that comes with experience.

I also got some insight into what the design team does beyond just making things look good.
There seems to be a lot of thought and work that goes into every design decision, and there is
a lot more involvement with the client than I first realized. Rather than being a segmented piece
of development, design seems to permeate all the steps from start to finish in our projects.

### What are you going to do today?

This morning, I'll be fixing some documentation on SmashingDocs. It's missing some instructions
regarding the new configs. This afternoon I'm paring with Brian, so I'm sure I'll learn a lot of
new things from him.

### What do you expect to learn?

It's interesting to see everyone's different workstyles. Everyone approaches things a
little differently, and I think this pairing tour will help me get a view of all the
different styles people have here.
